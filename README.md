## TODO

- Change 'clock delay' to 'clock rate' ie. 1.0 for 60hz 0.5 for 30hz etc?
- It seems that there should be 10 instructions processed per cycle
- Implement remaining instructions
- Unit tests like: https://github.com/mir3z/chip8-emu/blob/master/src/chip8-is.js
- How to test interpreter command mapping in isolation?
- Scroll log to highlighted line
